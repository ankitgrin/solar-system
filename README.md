# Solar System Project

This is a simple solar system visualization created using Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics. The project displays the sun and several planets orbiting around it, with textures mapped onto the surfaces of each celestial body.

## Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of the solar system.
- Planets rotate around their own axes as well as orbit around the sun.
- Textured surfaces for each planet.
- Saturn and Uranus have rings that are also visualized.

## Technologies Used
